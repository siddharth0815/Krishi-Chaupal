                            <p>Agricultural phases are exposed to controllable and uncontrollable risks. Controllable risks are pests, diseases, weeds, seed and faulty fertilizers or pesticides. Uncontrollable risks are deficit or excess rainfall, distribution of rainfall, extreme temperature conditions, hail storms, wind speeds, humidity and fog etc. Technology, effective monitoring and usage of inputs mitigate controllable risk. The challenge is risk mitigation for uncontrollable risks.</p>

                        		<h5> In a world of rising population, diminishing arable land, mounting agricultural debts and increasing uncertainties in farm incomes, there is a great need for management of risks in the agriculture sector. The enterprise of agriculture is subject to 81 great many uncertainties. Yet more people in India earn their livelihood from this sector than from all other sectors put together. In rural India, households that depend on income from agriculture (either self-employed or as agricultural labour) accounted for nearly 70% of population (estimates from Survey of Consumption Expenditures, National Sample Survey, 1999/00). This includes large number of the poor who have little means of coping with adversities. Poor households that were self-employed in agriculture account for 28% of all rural poverty while poor households that are primarily dependent on agricultural labour account for 47% of all rural poverty . Thus, 75% of all rural poor are in households that are dependent on agriculture, in one way or the other. The same survey shows that 77% of all poverty is rural. Thus 58% of all poor are in households that are dependent on agricultural income in rural areas. Risk and uncertainty are inescapable factors in agriculture. The uncertainties of weather, yields, prices, government policies, global markets, and other factors can cause wide swings in agricultural income. All these risks must be properly managed to achieve satisfactory management in agriculture. It involves choosing among alternatives that reduce the financial effects of such uncertainties.

 <h5>Management of risk in agriculture is one of the major concerns of the decision makers and policy planners, as risk in farm output is considered as the primary cause for low level of farm level investments and agrarian distress. Both, in turn, have implications for output growth. In order to develop mechanisms and strategies to mitigate risk in agriculture it is imperative to know the sources and magnitude of fluctuations involved in agricultural output.
Farmers are exposed to risk from rainfall variability, market price fluctuations, credit uncertainty and adoption of new technology. The diversities in the sources of risks require a variety of instruments for protecting the farmers. In India, these include crop insurance, rainfall insurance, farm income insurance and a calamity relief fund. Most of these measures other than crop insurance are in the experimental stage. Different sources of risk that affect agriculture are classified below. <br><br>

• Production Risk  <br>
• Price or Market Risk <br>
• Financial and Credit Risk  <br>
• Institutional Risk  <br>
• Human or Personal Risk <br>
• Legal / Policy Risk  <br>
• Resource Risk <br>
• Health Risks <br>
• Assets Risks  <br>
• Technology Risk <br>
</h5><br>

<h3>PRODUCTION RISK </h3>

<h5>Agriculture is often characterized by high variability of production outcomes or production risk. Unlike most other entrepreneurs, farmers are not able to predict with certainty the amount of output that the production process will yield due to external factors such as weather, pests, and diseases. Farmers can also be hindered by adverse events during harvesting or threshing that may result in production losses. Development and adoption of innovations also add to production risk in agriculture. In India, more than 60 percent of land is vulnerable to droughts. Droughts lead to economic losses resulting from low agricultural production, loss of animal wealth, reduced nutrition and loss of health of workers.</h5><br>


<h3>PRICE OR MARKET RISK</h3>

<h5>Price or market risk refers to uncertainty about the prices producers will receive for commodities or the prices they must pay for inputs. The nature of price risk varies significantly from commodity to commodity.  The market risks result from fluctuations in the prices of inputs and outputs, outside competition, changing supply and demand, market imperfections, changing consumer preferences, etc. Sale of farm produce under distress may take place due to lack of post harvest processing and lack of infrastructure storage facilities.</h5> <br>


<h3>FINANCIAL AND CREDIT RISK</h3>

 <h5>Many agricultural production cycles stretch over long periods of time, and farmers must anticipate expenses that they will only be able to recuperate once the product is marketed. This leads to potential cash flow problems exacerbated by lack of access to insurance services, credit and the high cost of borrowing. This also creates an obligation to repay debt. Rising interest rates, the prospect of loans being called by lenders, and restricted credit availability to the farmers lead to financial risks. </h5><br>


<h3>INSTITUTIONAL RISK </h3>

<h5>Important source of uncertainty for farmers is institutional risk, generated by unexpected changes in regulations that influence farmers’ activities. Changes in regulations, financial services, level of price or income support payments and subsidies can significantly alter the profitability of farming activities. </h5><br>


<h3>HUMAN OR PERSONAL RISK</h3>

<h5>This risk refers to factors such as problems with human health or personal relationships that can affect the agriculture. Agricultural households, as any other economic entrepreneur, are exposed to personal risks affecting the life and the wellbeing of people who work on the farm, as also asset risks from floods, cyclones and droughts and possible damage or theft of production equipment and any other farming assets. </h5><br>


<h3>LEGAL / POLICY RISK</h3>

 <h5>The legal and policy risk arises due to changes in the government policies related to agriculture, failure to comply with contractual obligations, etc.</h5><br>


<h3>RESOURCE RISK</h3>

 <h5>The resource risks include uncertain supply or nonavailability of labour (skilled labour), credit and irrigation water and also timely supply of desired seed, fertilizer or plant protection chemicals. Supply of spurious seeds and plant protection chemicals pose a great risk to the producers. Failure of crops due to sub-standard seed or spurious plant protection chemicals causes drain of resources of the farmer. It inflicts considerable damage on the psyche of the farmer sometimes leading to suicides by the farmers. </h5><br>


<h3>HEALTH RISKS</h3>

 <h5>The health risk arises due to sickness or injury to the farmer, low labour productivity due to poor labour management, family disputes, accidental death, etc.</h5><br>


<h3>ASSETS RISKS</h3>

 <h5>The trade-off is most acute for small farmers because their opportunities for ex-post management of risk through credit are limited. When all other measures fail, farmers have no option but to sell their assets (principally livestock) or to migrate out to regions with better work opportunities.</h5><br>

 <h3>TECHNOLOGY RISK </h3>

<h5>Like most other entrepreneurs, farmers are responsible for all the consequences of their activities. Adoption of new technologies in modernizing agriculture such as in introduction of genetically modified crops causes an increase in producer liability risk. </h5>

<h5>In order to cope with various risks, farmers and rural societies have developed number of risk management strategies. These can be grouped as risk-reducing and risk-coping strategies (Walker and Jodha 1986). The ex-ante measures adopted to lower or minimize risks can be grouped as risk-reducing strategies whereas ex-post measures adopted to mitigate risks are classified as risk-coping measures or strategies. </h5><br>
<br><br>
<img src="img/riskstrategies.png"> </a>
<br><br><br>

<h3>RISK-REDUCING STRATEGIES(ex-ante)</h3>

<h5>Risk-reducing strategies adopted by farmers include crop diversification, inter-cropping / mix cropping, or cultivation of drought or flood resistant crops. Diversification of activities, engaging in nonfarm/ off-farm activities, getting into contractual arrangements such as share cropping, labour hiring, etc. also form a part of ex-ante risk mitigating strategies. </h5><br>

 <h3>CROP DIVERSIFICATION</h3>

 <h5>Crop diversification is the most common and effective risk management strategy that is employed by the farmers. The farmer spreads risk across multiple crops and even if one crop fails, it is compensated by another crop. However, crop diversification leads to spreading of limited resources across crops and the price paid for diversification is income foregone or sacrificed by not growing the most remunerative crop. The same argument holds true in the case of intercropping also. </h5><br>

<h3>INTERCROPPING </h3>

<h5>Intercropping lowers yield risks because of lower incidence of insect/pest damage as well as disease. Intercropping has greater potential for yield compensation. It also provides opportunity to grow short duration crops along with long duration crops thus minimizing competition for soil nutrients and maximising the use of soil moisture, sunlight, etc. Even though intercropping is not found effective in reducing production risk as shown by positive covariance between the yields of inter crops (Walker and Jodha 1986), it certainly helps in avoiding complete crop failure (Singh and Walker 1984). </h5><br>

<h3>TENANCY OR SHARE-CROPPING</h3>

 <h5>Tenancy or share-cropping helps to minimize risk in production. Share cropping is more beneficial particularly when the tenant is a small farmer and averse to risk, as the tenant has to share a fraction of output to the land owner and he is insulated against the fluctuations in output. On the contrary, ease or fixed tenancy shifts the entire risk of production to the tenant farmer. The risk-reducing strategy stabilizes farm income but at the same time the farmer has to forego income from other alternative activity, which would have fetched higher income. Similarly, diversification is usually less profitable on average than crop specialization (Hazell 1992).</h5><br>

 <h3>RISK-COPING STRATEGIES</h3>

 <h5>Farm families adopt different strategies to adjust the shortfall in income. The ex-post measures taken to mitigate the impact of income losses include self insurance, sale of assets, stored produce, and receipt of transfers from relatives, borrowals for consumption, increase labour participation and even migration for better employment opportunities. </h5><br>

<h3>SELF INSURANCE</h3>

 <h5>This is the most important mechanism for consumption smoothing other than market credit and interfamily lending, sale and purchase of assets. Agricultural households hold many different forms of wealth including land, capital goods such as pump sets and tractors, animals, jewellery, currency and stocks of food grains. Self insurance relates to using such assets as buffer stocks. Farmers accumulate stocks in period of relative affluence and deplete these reserves to finance consumption expenditures during tough times. </h5><br> <br><br>
